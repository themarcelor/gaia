The core system of Project Zero Dawn. GAIA's primary function is to react against the damage caused by the Faro Swarm and oversee operations to make the Earth eventually come back to life. GAIA is assisted by nine subordinate-functions: Aether, Apollo, Artemis, Demeter, Eleuthia, Hades, Hephaestus, Minerva, Poseidon, each dedicated to a single task.
